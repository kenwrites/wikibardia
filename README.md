# What is this?

Implementation of a Shakespeare translation API from [FunTranslations](https://funtranslations.com/api#) for [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/).  

# What is here? 

- Search for an article from Wikipedia
- Get a Bard-ified version from FunTranslations

# If it don't work:

The FunTranslations API is rate-limited.  It only allows 5 calls per hour, so it's pretty easy to run out of free calls.
