# What is this?

Implementation of a Shakespeare translation API from [FunTranslations](https://funtranslations.com/api#) for [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/).  

# What is here? 

- Wikipedia API up and running
- FunTranslations API up and running

# What is next? 

- Allow user to search for a Wikipedia article before submitting for translation.  

# If it don't work:

The FunTranslations API that returns the Bard-ified text is rate-limited.  Only allows 5 calls per hour, so it's pretty easy to run out of free calls.
